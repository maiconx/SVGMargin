SVGMargin 1.0

**I created this script because whenever I export an SVG from Illustrator, the SVG gets cut off in some software. This script solves that issue by adding a margin around the image.**

I used Auto PY to EXE to export to an executable on Windows.

```
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

```
auto-py-to-exe
```
